payload = {
    "text": "The intricate interplay between syntactic parsing algorithms and semantic vector embeddings necessitates a reevaluation of traditional natural language understanding frameworks.",
    "target_reading_level": "simple",
    "output_language": "en" # Use "same" for original language, or a 2-letter ISO code (e.g., "ar", "es")
}

response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, json=payload)

if response.status_code == 200:
    simplified_data = response.json()
